<h1 class="header">Lesson 3: Quantified Repetition</h1>
<div class="readable">
    <p>In the last tutorial, we learned about the basic repetition metacharacters, but as you saw with both the asterisk and the plus, they allow for an amount of unlimited repetition. So they allowed us to have this ridiculous example where we had apples with seven Ss after it. Now, we saw how we could deal with if something just had zero or one repetitions, but what if we need some more precision than that? Well, to do that, we need to use quantified repetition, and that's what we're going to learn in this movie. To do that, we need a couple of more metacharacters, and these are the opening and closing curly braces.</p>
    <p>We'll see how to use them in just a minute. The curly braces are still going to have an effect on the preceding item, exactly the same as the plus, the asterisk, and the question mark did. The syntax for using them is going to be to put an opening curly brace and then minimum, maximum, and the closing curly brace. Now, min and max are not the actual words min and max; they're going to be positive numbers that you're going to drop in there that are going to quantify it for you and tell you how many times this thing should be repeated. Min must always been included.</p>
    <p>In other words, there must always be a first number there. But it can be 0. If it's possible for something not to exist, well then you can put a 0 in there. Max is optional, and the comma is actually optional as well. Let's take a look at the three possible syntaxes for the ways that you could use this. Let's start with just a basic digit metacharacter shorthand class. So we've got a digit that is repeated, 4,8. That's a minimum of 4 times, a maximum of 8 times. That matches numbers with 4 and 8 digits.</p>
    <p>Now, notice that it's a comma; it's not a hyphen. 4-8, that's not going to work for you. It's got to be a comma in between those. Now, if we only put one thing in there, essentially that min value, well then in that case, minimum also becomes the maximum. And so in that case, it matches something that has exactly 4 digits, that occurs 4 times, not 3, not 5. The last way that you can use it looks a bit odd, and that's where we have a comma still, but this time we've left out the max, and in that case, maximum becomes infinite.</p>
    <p>So we don't have a character to represent infinite that we can easily just type in there, so instead we just leave the comma in and that lets us differentiate between the one and the line above it. The one above it says match exactly 4 times; the second one says a minimum of 4 times, and infinite maximum. Let's look at a couple of examples. If we have the \d and we were to have 0 for a minimum, comma, infinite maximum, well then that's the same thing as our star character. It can occur 0 times or an infinite number of times.</p>
    <p>If we had one comma and left maximum blank, that's the same thing as our plus character. Those are equivalent to doing the same thing. To show you another example, let's say that we wanted to match phone numbers, a very common use case. We could say, well we want three digits, followed by a dash, followed by three digits, followed by a dash, followed by four digits. So we could just as easily write out the \d all those times, but instead, we're saying, precisely this number of times, repeat it. You don't have to type it out; you can use this quantified repetition as a shorthand.</p>
