<p>To define a character set we use brackets ([])</p>
<p>A character set helps you find anyone of several characters. But one character set only applies to one character. The order of the items in the character set doesn’t matter. You’re basically just saying these are the items that can match.</p>
<p>Ex. /[aeiou]/  will match any vowel.
Ex. /f[ea]t/ will match fet and fat but not feat or feet.
